This is a journal of what worked, what didnâ€™t, what I had to install, issues I ran into, how I fixed those issues, etc.

The most simple way for me to start out on gcp with a node project was to start at the tutorial.
    - I made a boiler plate just in case I want to start a fresh porject some day

Gcp documentation works well because the docs are very easy to read and understand.
I came accross a problem with not being able to link to my css folder with my styles.css file
    -After looking through some stackoverflow forum pages I found someone else who had a similar issue
    -https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34073076/node-js-express-framework-cant-get-css-file
    -I simply needed contain all my css and html views in a folder named public.

I am looking into https://startbootstrap.com/snippets/video-header/ this site to possibly introduce a background video as an idea for my page.

TODO
I want to be able to take a user's email and notes from them if they are interested in my services. I was looking into firebase for an easy database integration.

I want to make bootstrap cards that take my latest videos and pictures from instagram

I need to add features of code project I have worked on or at least the new hot dog app.

I want to learn why my site doesnt direct to https 

Pointing my google custom domain to my project hosted by gcp was interesting because...
I bought a custom domain for this site with my personal account and have free money supplied by Wu and Google on my student account.
-Our student accounts are disabled so you have to buy your domain from a personal account
    - this makes sense because our student account are not permanent.
-You can link your persoanl account to your student account in order to be able to use the $50 credit

-After giving permissions to my student account for the custom domain I could simply
add a custom domain in the App Engine Settings. Luckly there is plenty of documentation for this.
